    "\n",
    "In e-commerce, **customer retention is 5-25x cheaper than acquisition**. Yet most companies focus disproportionately on acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Industry Average | Top Performers |\n",
    "|--------|-----------------|----------------|\n",
    "| Annual Churn Rate | 20-30% | 5-10% |\n",
    "| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | $50-150 | $30-80 |\n",
    "| Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) | $150-400 | $500+ |\n",
    "| Retention ROI | 3-5x | 8-12x |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why Predict Churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reactive Approach** (Traditional):\n",
    "- Customer stops buying  Company notices  Too late to act\n",
    "- Win-back campaigns have <5% success rate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proactive Approach** (This Project):\n",
    "- Predict churn risk  Intervene early  Retain customer\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CHURN = A customer who has NOT made any purchase in 60 consecutive days\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Why 60 Days?\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of churn window is **critical** and must be data-driven:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Window | Pros | Cons | Use Case |\n",
    "|--------|------|------|----------|\n",
    "| **30 days** | Quick detection | High false positives (seasonal buyers) | Subscription services |\n",
    "| **60 days** | Balanced signal | Moderate delay | **General e-commerce** |\n",
    "| **90 days** | Few false positives | Late detection, harder to recover | Luxury/high-ticket items |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Rationale for 60 Days:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Purchase Cycle Analysis**: Typical retail customers purchase every 30-45 days. A 60-day gap represents ~1.5-2x normal cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Actionability**: 60 days provides enough lead time for:\n",
    "   - Email re-engagement campaigns (2-3 weeks)\n",
    "   - Personalized offers (1-2 weeks)\n",
    "   - Customer success outreach (1 week)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Significance**: Based on industry benchmarks, probability of return drops significantly after 60 days:\n",
    "   - Day 30: 65% return probability\n",
    "   - Day 60: 35% return probability\n",
    "   - Day 90: 15% return probability\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Business Alignment**: Most retail retention budgets operate on quarterly cycles; 60-day detection allows for one intervention cycle before quarter-end reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Operational Definition\n",
    "\n",
